Minecraft Java version Seed Cracker

# Usage

1. Install the Bobby mod and join the world you want to crack the seed of. You can exit the game once the terrain starts to load.
2. Inside your `.minecraft/.bobby/[server address]` folder, find the folder with the correct world data inside. The folder name is the hash of the seed.
3. Run `java -cp lib/guava-32.1.3-jre.jar:. Main`. When prompted, paste your hash in and hit Enter/Return.
4. Wait until the seed has been found. (It may take up to 1 real-world day to find a 9-11 digit seed on a typical Apple Silicon machine.)

> Attention: If you encounter high RAM usage, please make sure your terminal's scrollback setting is set to **a limited value**.
